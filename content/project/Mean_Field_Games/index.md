The mean-field game theory is the study of strategic decision making in very large populations of weakly interacting individuals. Mean-field games have been an active area of research in the last decade due to its increased significance in many scientific fields. The foundations of mean-field theory go back to the theory of statistical and quantum physics. One may describe mean-field games as a type of stochastic differential game for which the interaction between the players is of mean-field type, i.e the players are coupled via their empirical measure. It was proposed by Larsy and Lions and independently by Huang, Malhame, and Caines. Since then, the mean-field games have become a rapidly growing area of research and has been studied by many researchers. However, most of these studies were dedicated to diffusion-type games. The main purpose of this project is to extend the theory of mean-field games to jump case in both discrete and continuous state space. Jump processes are a very important tool in many areas of applications. Specifically, when modeling abrupt events appearing in real life. For instance, financial modeling (option pricing and risk management), networks (electricity and Banks) and statistics (for modeling and analyzing spatial data). The project consists of two papers and one technical report:
- An Epsilon Nash Equilibrium For Non-Linear Markov Games of Mean-Field-Type on Finite Spaces.
- An approximate Nash equilibrium for pure jump Markov games of mean-field-type on continuous state space.

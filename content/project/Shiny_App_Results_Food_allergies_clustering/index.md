Clustering is central to many data-driven application domains and it has been investigated
intensively in terms of algorithms and distance functions. Some of the most used traditional clustering
methods are k-means and Hierarchical clustering. Both methods suffer from many issues when dealing
with highly hetroginuoius data types. A typical challenge in clustering heterogeneous data lies in handling
both numerical and categorical variables at the same time. Many commonly used approaches are limited
in reflecting the correct distance that is needed to perform a good clustering. Another challenge in these
classical algorithms is the definition of the distance matrix. Finding the right way to measure the distance
between objects has a huge influence on the clustering performance. Both k-means and Hierarchal clustering
constitute a vast majority of the unsupervised statistical methods that are used in the phenotyping within the
airway disease literature. When data is large enough, new deep unsupervised and semi-supervised learning
methods outperform traditional clustering methods in many ways. We plan to utilize the huge steps and
findings in the area of deep unsupervised learning in our various phenotyping projects.
